# ðŸ“Š Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“š Project Overview
This project provides an interactive Tableau dashboard for analyzing road accident data. The goal is to identify trends, accident severity levels, and contributing factors to enhance road safety awareness and decision-making.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
- **File Name**: `accident_data.csv`
- **Description**: The dataset contains road accident records with details such as location, severity, vehicle type, weather conditions, and timestamps.
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Accident Severity`: Categorized as **Fatal, Serious, or Slight**
  - `Date & Time`: Timestamp of the accident
  - `Location`: Latitude & Longitude of accident spots
  - `Weather Conditions`: Environmental factors at the time of the accident
  - `Vehicle Type`: Type of vehicles involved
  - `Road Type`: Characteristics of the road where the accident occurred

## ðŸ“ˆ Accident Severity Analysis
The dashboard categorizes accidents into three severity levels:
- **Fatal**: Accidents resulting in loss of life.
- **Serious**: Accidents causing major injuries but no fatalities.
- **Slight**: Minor accidents with no major injuries.

### Key Insights
- The **distribution of accident severity** across different locations and time periods.
- **Peak accident times** and **high-risk areas** based on historical data.
- **Impact of weather and road conditions** on accident severity.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau**: For data visualization
- **GitHub**: For version control and project sharing
